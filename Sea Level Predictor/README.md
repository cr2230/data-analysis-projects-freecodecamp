# global-sea-level-forecast
This is the final project in freeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python certification. From all of the projects, this one was my favourite as it provides alarming insight into the rate at which our global sea levels are increasing. This is a global problem that effects the entire world. I use standard linear regressions to model global sea level data from the US Environmental Protection Agency and make forecasts up to 2050. This was both a fun and eye-opening project and it has made me ponder how much I contribute to rising levels.
