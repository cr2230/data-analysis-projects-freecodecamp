    "You must use Pandas to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (race column)\n",
    "- What is the average age of men?\n",
    "- What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?\n",
    "- What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?\n",
    "- What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?\n",
    "- What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?\n",
    "- What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?\n",
    "- What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?\n",
    "- Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.\n",
